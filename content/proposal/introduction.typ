= Introduction
The paradigm of software development has increasingly shifted towards cloud-based solutions, with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) being no exception @rai:2024:IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment. Cloud IDEs, such as Eclipse Theia, offer significant advantages in educational settings by providing students with uniform, pre-configured development environments accessible from any web browser @valez:2020:StudentAdoptionPerceptions. This eliminates setup friction and ensures consistency across a large cohort of students. At the Technical University of Munich, Theia is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster to provide a scalable platform for programming courses.

A cornerstone of modern IDEs is the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which decouples language-specific intelligence from the editor's user interface @rask:2021:SpecificationLanguageServer. Under this protocol, a separate process, the language server is responsible for features like code completion and diagnostics. For Java development in Theia, this role is filled by the Eclipse JDT Language Server, a powerful but resource-intensive component running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The current deployment architecture is the central focus of the re-architecting effort described in this proposal.
