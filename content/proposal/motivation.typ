= Motivation

The motivation for this project is threefold, directly impacting the platform's operators, its users, and the scientific community.

First, from an operational standpoint, the primary driver is *resource optimization and cost reduction*. By consolidating multiple language server instances into a shared JVM model, the platform's overall memory footprint is drastically reduced. This directly lowers infrastructure costs and allows for supporting more concurrent users on the same hardware @leitner:2012:ApplicationlevelPerformanceMonitoring.

Second, for users, the goal is to *enhance the developer experience*. A more efficient server-side architecture leads to faster session startup times and reduced latency, providing a more responsive environment for students.
